## 1. Motivation

Markets are emotional. Behind every price movement lives fear, hope, greed, anxiety, euphoria—the full spectrum of human feeling compressed into numbers.

But emotions are invisible. Charts show lines, not sentiment. Prices capture transactions, not psychology.

**What if we could make financial emotions visible?**

Generative AI can translate data into forms humans perceive. Language becomes images. Numbers become narratives. So why not translate market psychology into paintings?

Solana's memecoin markets—where rationality and irrationality collide at light speed—are the purest expression of collective financial emotion. Every buy is hope. Every sell is doubt. Every spike is euphoria, every crash is panic.

DOOM INDEX was born to **archive these emotions**—transforming raw market data into paintings that capture what the numbers alone never could: how the market _felt_ at that exact moment.

---

## 2. What DOOM INDEX Is

**DOOM INDEX is a decentralized archive of financial emotions—an onchain system where AI generates paintings every hour, translating the collective psychology of trending memecoins into visual art.**

The system dynamically selects the most culturally dominant memecoin each hour. When a token captures the zeitgeist—through viral marketing, celebrity endorsements, or genuine innovation—it becomes the protagonist of that hour's painting.

**Market emotion becomes visual emotion.** Every painting is a timestamp of collective psychology—a permanent record of how thousands of traders felt at that exact moment in time.

---

## 3. How the Painting Is Generated

Every hour, the system captures trending token data and translates it into a painting through a weighted composition algorithm:

### The Algorithm

**1. Market Observation & Token Selection**
The system monitors CoinGecko trending data and selects the most culturally dominant memecoin through a weighted scoring algorithm:

```
finalScore = 0.50*trend + 0.35*impact + 0.15*mood
```

**2. Psychological Translation**
Market data (volume, volatility, sentiment) is transformed through 10 context components, each mapping conditions to artistic elements in a medieval allegorical framework.

**3. Weighted Medieval Allegory**
The selected token maps to a visual archetype. The AI receives a weighted prompt in the format `(element:weight)`, creating a medieval allegorical oil painting where visual presence directly reflects market dominance.

**4. Deterministic Output**
Same market state = same painting. The system uses a hash of the rounded market caps to skip regeneration when nothing significant has changed, ensuring consistency.

### The 10 Context Components

Market data transforms into artistic language through these elements:

| Context Component | Meaning                                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Market Climate    | Weather = mood                            |
| Archetype         | Story the token carries                   |
| Event Pressure    | Ritual intensity (worship / condemnation) |
| Composition       | Rising → heaven / Falling → abyss         |
| Palette           | Greed=Gold / Fear=Burgundy                |
| Dynamics          | Vortex of chaos, or tranquility           |
| Motifs            | Cryptic allegorical icons                 |
| Texture           | Heavy or fluid                            |
| Light Narrative   | Salvation or judgment                     |
| Symbolic Density  | Pressure filling the world                |

These components combine into a weighted prompt:

```
A high medieval allegory of {Archetype},
under a {Climate} market mood,
{Motifs}, {Dynamics},
oil painting, allegorical, dramatic lighting.
(seed={deterministicHash})
```

### AI as Interpreter

> _"There are no facts, only interpretations."_
> — Friedrich Nietzsche

DOOM INDEX doesn't show you "the truth" about markets—it shows you an **interpretation**.

Charts display numbers. Prices show transactions. These are valuable, but they're one way to see markets. DOOM INDEX offers another: **emotional translation**. The AI doesn't analyze or predict. It translates market psychology into visual language, the same way a poet translates feelings into words.

When AI interprets market data through symbolic mapping, you experience the market from a different angle—not as data, but as **atmosphere**.

**Deterministic Output**
Same market state = same painting. The system uses a hash of the rounded market caps to skip regeneration when nothing significant has changed, ensuring consistency.

---

## 5. Future Plans: Beyond v2

### Where We're Going

DOOM INDEX proves that markets can be art. But there's room to evolve. Right now, every painting is archived but the community has no voice in what matters most.

**Future versions will introduce DOOM DAO and Season NFTs** to address this.

### DOOM DAO: Community Governance (Coming Soon)

Holding **$DOOM** tokens will grant governance power over key areas:

**1. Index Composition** — Decide which tokens can influence the painting. Should certain token categories be prioritized? The community votes.

**2. Historical Curation** — Every season (~30-90 days), the DAO votes on which moments to preserve. "Best DOOM" captures the most apocalyptic painting, "Least DOOM" the most hopeful. These will be immortalized as NFTs.

**3. Model Evolution** — Should DOOM INDEX train a custom art style? Which visual direction should it explore? The community decides the aesthetic future.

### Season NFTs: Preserving History

The system logs every painting with full market data. The community nominates historically significant moments, and the DAO votes on which matter most. Winners get regenerated in ultra-high resolution (4K-8K) and minted as permanent NFTs on Solana.

Each NFT becomes a **timestamp of collective psychology**—proof that on a specific date, the market felt a certain way and looked like this.

### Why $DOOM Will Have Value

**$DOOM = The right to curate internet capital market history**

The value of DOOM INDEX doesn't come from hype—it comes from a structural intersection of **AI × Art × Collective Memory**.

Here's why this matters:

#### 1. AI Evolution = Permanent Art Value Increase

DOOM INDEX paintings aren't static—they evolve with AI technology itself. Better AI models produce better paintings from the same market data. Prompt algorithms continuously improve. Season NFTs become **cultural snapshots of AI capability at that moment**.

**As AI gets better, the archive gets more valuable.** Since NFTs don't degrade, this "continuous quality increase" creates long-term value for the entire archive.

#### 2. Community as Market Memory Editors

Hourly generation equals infinite output, but only a few moments get preserved. $DOOM holders decide which moments to immortalize as NFTs, which tokens should enter the index, which direction the visual style evolves, and ultimately what history gets written.

**$DOOM = Editorial rights to market history.** As Season NFTs accumulate, these editorial rights gain compounding cultural and economic value.

#### 3. The Art × Meme Crossroads

DOOM INDEX isn't just art. It's not just memecoin. It's where **market volatility becomes emotion**. Meme market volatility translates into painting emotion. Every screenshot shared on X creates self-propagating presence.

In crypto culture, strong context creates art value while strong memes create crypto value. DOOM INDEX has both. It sits at the rare intersection where **cultural capital meets meme capital**.

---

**In Summary**, $DOOM value is built on three reinforcing layers: AI progress lifts archive quality forever, DAO curation creates scarcity from infinity, and the Art × Meme position captures maximum cultural attention. This isn't just price—it's the infrastructure for **markets recording their own history**.
