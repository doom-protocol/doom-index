## 1. Motivation

Markets are emotional. Behind every price movement lives fear, hope, greed, anxiety, euphoria—the full spectrum of human feeling compressed into numbers.

But emotions are invisible. Charts show lines, not sentiment. Prices capture transactions, not psychology.

**What if we could make financial emotions visible?**

Generative AI can translate data into forms humans perceive. Language becomes images. Numbers become narratives. So why not translate market psychology into paintings?

Solana's memecoin markets—where rationality and irrationality collide at light speed—are the purest expression of collective financial emotion. Every buy is hope. Every sell is doubt. Every spike is euphoria, every crash is panic.

DOOM INDEX was born to **archive these emotions**—transforming raw market data into paintings that capture what the numbers alone never could: how the market _felt_ at that exact moment.

### The Evolution from v1 to v2

**v1 (Current)** is the proof of concept—fixed 8 tokens, fully automated generation, one new painting every minute. It demonstrates that markets can become art.

**v2 (Coming Soon)** introduces dynamic token selection and cultural archiving. Instead of fixed tokens, the system selects the most culturally relevant memecoin each hour. This creates a living archive that evolves with crypto culture itself.

## 2. What DOOM INDEX v2 Is

v2 marks a radical shift:

| v1                  | v2                                        |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Fixed 8 tokens      | **Dynamically varying "1 token symbolizing the moment"** |
| Market capture → art | **Psychological translation → symbolic art** |
| Prototype           | **Cultural archive**                      |

### Key Concept

> **The most culturally dominant memecoin at this moment becomes the protagonist of the painting.**

Crypto culture changes every hour → DOOM INDEX changes with it.

## 3. Architecture

Fully autonomous from trend selection to painting preservation.

![Painting generation pipeline](/diagrams/generation-process.svg)

The system runs on Cloudflare infrastructure:
- **Cron Triggers**: Hourly execution
- **Workers**: Serverless computation
- **D1 Database**: Market data storage
- **R2 Storage**: Image archival

### The Algorithm

**1. Market Observation**
The system captures the market state through multiple psychological indicators, creating a comprehensive snapshot of collective sentiment.

**2. Dynamic Token Selection**
Unlike v1's fixed 8 tokens, v2 selects the single most culturally dominant memecoin through a weighted scoring algorithm that considers trending momentum, market impact, and emotional resonance.

**3. Psychological Translation**
Statistical data is transformed through 10 distinct context components, each mapping market conditions to artistic elements in a medieval allegorical framework.

**4. AI Interpretation**
Runware FLUX Kontext AI interprets the weighted prompt to create a deterministic painting that captures the market's emotional state.

**5. Permanent Archival**
Each painting is stored with full market context in Cloudflare D1 and R2, creating an immutable record of financial emotion.

## 4. How Generation Works

Every hour, the system captures market data and translates it into a painting through a weighted composition algorithm:

### Step A — Market Observation

Obtain collective psychological indicators from CoinGecko / Alternative.me

| Metric             | Psychological Meaning                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Trending rank      | "Gaze intensity" — interest as heat   |
| Volume / MCap      | "Dominance" — how much it moves the world |
| Volatility         | "Instability" — emotional turbulence  |
| Fear & Greed Index | Market emotional polarity             |

### Step B — Symbol Token Selection

Select what most symbolizes the current moment

```
finalScore = 0.50*trend + 0.35*impact + 0.15*mood
```

Examples:

- During crashes, death symbols become protagonists
- When markets euphorize, golden idols move to center stage

**1. Relative Dominance Calculation**
The token with the highest market cap becomes the reference point. All other tokens are weighted relative to this dominant token—not to fixed thresholds. This means the painting always reflects _which forces are stronger than others_ at that moment.

**2. Non-Linear Emphasis**
A power function amplifies differences. If FEAR is 2x higher than HOPE, the visual weight difference becomes even more pronounced. This makes dominant emotions clearly visible in the composition.

### Step C — Translating Data Into Symbols

Convert statistical values → psychology → art language (10 elements)

Each token maps to a visual motif through symbolic mapping. The AI receives a weighted prompt in the format `(element:weight)`, creating a medieval allegorical oil painting where visual presence directly reflects market dominance.

| Context Component | Meaning                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Market Climate    | Weather = mood                       |
| Archetype         | Story the token carries              |
| Event Pressure    | Ritual intensity (worship / condemnation) |
| Composition       | Rising → heaven / Falling → abyss   |
| Palette           | Greed=Gold / Fear=Burgundy           |
| Dynamics          | Vortex of chaos, or tranquility      |
| Motifs            | Cryptic allegorical icons            |
| Texture           | Heavy or fluid                       |
| Light Narrative   | Salvation or judgment                |
| Symbolic Density  | Pressure filling the world           |

### Step D — Allegorical Prompt Generation

Convert to literary financial poetry

```
A high medieval allegory of {Archetype},
under a {Climate} market mood,
{Motifs}, {Dynamics},
oil painting, allegorical, dramatic lighting.
(seed={deterministicHash})
```

### Step E — Image Generation

Psychological depiction by Runware FLUX Kontext AI

- Greed → Light intensifies
- Fear → Darkness deepens
- High volatility → Brush strokes become rough
- When eras shift → The painting moves

### Step F — Archival

Permanent preservation in Cloudflare D1 + R2

= Record of the doomsday clock

### AI as Interpreter

> _"There are no facts, only interpretations."_
> — Friedrich Nietzsche

DOOM INDEX doesn't show you "the truth" about markets—it shows you an **interpretation**.

Charts display numbers. Prices show transactions. These are valuable, but they're one way to see markets. DOOM INDEX offers another: **emotional translation**. The AI doesn't analyze or predict. It translates market psychology into visual language, the same way a poet translates feelings into words.

When AI interprets market data through symbolic mapping, you experience the market from a different angle—not as data, but as **atmosphere**.

**Deterministic Output**
Same market state = same painting. The system uses a hash of the rounded market caps to skip regeneration when nothing significant has changed, ensuring consistency.

---

## 5. Cultural Significance

DOOM INDEX v2 represents a fundamental shift in how we understand and archive market psychology. Unlike traditional financial analysis, it creates a living emotional record that evolves with culture itself.

### A Mirror of Collective Unconscious

Market psychology reflects directly through the selection of culturally dominant tokens. When a particular memecoin captures the zeitgeist—whether through viral marketing, celebrity endorsements, or genuine innovation—it becomes the lens through which the entire market's emotional state is interpreted.

### A Doomsday Clock for Financial Sentiment

When fear dominates the market, darkness thickens in the paintings. When hope prevails, light breaks through. Each artwork becomes a visual gauge of collective anxiety levels, providing a real-time emotional barometer that traditional metrics cannot capture.

### A Chronicle of Speculative Culture

Future historians will cite DOOM INDEX as primary source material for understanding the emotional undercurrents of crypto markets. Every painting becomes a timestamp of collective psychology—a permanent record of how thousands of traders felt at that exact moment in time.

### Why This Matters Now

In an era where AI can generate infinite art, scarcity comes from **cultural relevance**. DOOM INDEX v2 doesn't just create art—it creates **historically significant art** by tying each piece to the most culturally dominant narrative of that moment.

Crypto's emotions don't vanish. They are archived, interpreted, and made visible for generations to come.
