## 1. Motivation

Markets are emotional. Behind every price movement lives fear, hope, greed, anxiety, euphoria—the full spectrum of human feeling compressed into numbers.

But emotions are invisible. Charts show lines, not sentiment. Prices capture transactions, not psychology.

**What if we could make financial emotions visible?**

Generative AI can translate data into forms humans perceive. Language becomes images. Numbers become narratives. So why not translate market psychology into paintings?

Solana's memecoin markets—where rationality and irrationality collide at light speed—are the purest expression of collective financial emotion. Every buy is hope. Every sell is doubt. Every spike is euphoria, every crash is panic.

DOOM INDEX was born to **archive these emotions**—transforming raw market data into paintings that capture what the numbers alone never could: how the market _felt_ at that exact moment.

## 2. What DOOM INDEX v2 Is

v2 marks a radical shift:

| v1                  | v2                                        |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Fixed 8 tokens      | **Dynamically varying "1 token symbolizing the moment"** |
| Market capture → art | **Psychological translation → symbolic art** |
| Prototype           | **Cultural archive**                      |

### Key Concept

> **The most culturally dominant memecoin at this moment becomes the protagonist of the painting.**

Crypto culture changes every hour → DOOM INDEX changes with it.

## 3. Architecture

Fully autonomous from trend selection to painting preservation.

![Generation architecture](/diagrams/generation-process.svg)

The system runs on Cloudflare infrastructure:

- **Cron Triggers**: Hourly execution
- **Workers**: Serverless computation
- **D1 Database**: Market data storage
- **R2 Storage**: Image archival

## 4. How Generation Works

### Step A — Market Observation

Obtain collective psychological indicators from CoinGecko / Alternative.me

| Metric             | Psychological Meaning                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Trending rank      | "Gaze intensity" — interest as heat   |
| Volume / MCap      | "Dominance" — how much it moves the world |
| Volatility         | "Instability" — emotional turbulence  |
| Fear & Greed Index | Market emotional polarity             |

### Step B — Symbol Token Selection

Select what most symbolizes the current moment

```
finalScore = 0.50*trend + 0.35*impact + 0.15*mood
```

Examples:

- During crashes, death symbols become protagonists
- When markets euphorize, golden idols move to center stage

### Step C — Translating Data Into Symbols

Convert statistical values → psychology → art language (10 elements)

| Context Component | Meaning                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Market Climate    | Weather = mood                       |
| Archetype         | Story the token carries              |
| Event Pressure    | Ritual intensity (worship / condemnation) |
| Composition       | Rising → heaven / Falling → abyss   |
| Palette           | Greed=Gold / Fear=Burgundy           |
| Dynamics          | Vortex of chaos, or tranquility      |
| Motifs            | Cryptic allegorical icons            |
| Texture           | Heavy or fluid                       |
| Light Narrative   | Salvation or judgment                |
| Symbolic Density  | Pressure filling the world           |

### Step D — Allegorical Prompt Generation

Convert to literary financial poetry

```
A high medieval allegory of {Archetype},
under a {Climate} market mood,
{Motifs}, {Dynamics},
oil painting, allegorical, dramatic lighting.
(seed={deterministicHash})
```

### Step E — Image Generation

Psychological depiction by Runware FLUX Kontext AI

- Greed → Light intensifies
- Fear → Darkness deepens
- High volatility → Brush strokes become rough
- When eras shift → The painting moves

### Step F — Archival

Permanent preservation in Cloudflare D1 + R2

= Record of the doomsday clock

## 5. Cultural Significance

DOOM INDEX is not just art:

📌 **A Mirror**
Market psychology reflects directly
The unconscious of crypto capitalism

📌 **A Doomsday Clock**
When fear dominates, darkness thickens
A device measuring distance to doom

📌 **A Chronicle**
Future historians will cite it
The historiography of speculative culture

Crypto's emotions don't vanish. They are archived.
